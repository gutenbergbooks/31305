<h3>AN &nbsp; INTERPRETATION &nbsp; OF<br />
HEINRICH &nbsp; HEINE'S<br />
"ATTA &nbsp; TROLL"</h3>


<p class="notes"><i>HE who has visited the idyllic isle of Corfu must
have seen, gleaming white amidst its surroundings
of dark green under a sky of the deepest blue, the
Greek villa which was erected there by Elizabeth,
Empress of Austria. It is called the Achilleion.
In its garden there is a small classic temple
in which the Empress caused to be placed a marble
statue of her most beloved of poets, Heinrich
Heine. The statue represented the poet seated,
his head bowed in profound melancholy, his
cheeks thin and drawn and bearded, as in his
last illness.</i></p>

<p><i>Elizabeth, Empress of Austria, felt a sentimental
affinity with the poet; his unhappiness,
his</i> Weltschmerz, <i>touched a responsive chord
in her own unhappy heart. Intellectual sympathy
with Heine's thought or tendencies there could<a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a>
have been little, for no woman has ever quite
understood Heinrich Heine, who is still a riddle
to most of the men of this age.</i></p>

<p><i>After the assassination of the hapless Empress,
the beautiful villa was bought by the German
Emperor. He at once ordered Heine's statue
to be removed&mdash;whither no one knows. Royal
(as well as popular) spite has before this been
vented on dead or inanimate things&mdash;one need
only ask Englishmen to remember what happened
to the body of Oliver Cromwell. The Kaiser's
action, by the way, did not pass unchallenged.
Not only in Germany but in several other
countries indignant voices were raised at the
time, protesting against an act so insulting to
the memory of the great singer, upholding the
fame of Heine as a poet and denouncing the new
master of the Achilleion for his narrow and
prejudiced views on art and literature.</i></p>

<p><i>There was, however, a sound reason for the
Imperial interference. Heinrich Heine was in
his day an outspoken enemy of Prussia, a severe
critic of the House of Hohenzollern and of other
Royal houses of Germany. He was one who<a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a>
held in scorn the principles of State and government
that are honoured in Germany, and elsewhere,
to this very day. He was one of those
poets&mdash;of whom the nineteenth century produced
only a few, but those amongst the greatest&mdash;who
had begun to distrust the capacity of the
reigning aristocracy, who knew what to expect
from the rising bourgeoisie, and who were nevertheless
not romantic enough to believe in the people
and the wonderful possibilities hidden in them.
These poets&mdash;one and all&mdash;have taken up a very
negative attitude towards their contemporaries
and have given voice to their anger and disappointment
over the pettiness of the society
and government of their time in words full of
satire and contempt.</i></p>

<p><i>Of course, the echo on the part of their
audiences has not been wanting. All these
poets have experienced a fate surprisingly similar,
and their relationship to their respective countries
reminds one of those unhappy matrimonial
alliances which&mdash;for social or religious reasons&mdash;no
divorce can ever dissolve. And, worse than
that, no separation either, for a poet is&mdash;through<a name="page_6" id="page_6"></a>
his mother tongue&mdash;so intimately wedded to
his country that not even a separation can effect
any sort of relief in such a desperate case. All
of them have tried separation, all of them have
lived in estrangement from their country&mdash;we
might almost say that only the local and lesser
poets of the last century have stayed at home&mdash;and
yet in spite of this separation the mutual
recriminations of these passionate poetical
husbands and their obstinate national wives
have never ceased. Again and again we hear
the male partner making proposals to win his
spouse to better and nobler ways, again and
again he tries to "educate her up to himself" and
endeavours to direct her anew, pointing out to
her the danger of her unruly and stupid behaviour;
again and again his loving approaches
are thwarted by the well-known waywardness
of the feminine character, and so all his friendly
admonitions habitually turn into torrents of
abuse and vilification. There have been many
unhappy unions in the world, but the compulsory</i>
mésalliances <i>of such great nineteenth-century
writers as Heine, Byron, Stendhal, Gobineau,<a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a>
and Nietzsche with Mesdames Britannia, Gallia,
and Germania, those otherwise highly respectable
ladies, easily surpass in grotesqueness anything
that has come to us through divorce court proceedings
in England and America. That, as
every one will agree, is saying a good deal.</i></p>

<p><i>The German Emperor, as I have said, had
some justification for his action, some motives
that do credit, if not to his intellect, at least
to what in our days best takes the place of
intellect; that is to say his character and his
principles of government. The German Emperor
appears at least to realize how offensive
and, from his point of view, dangerous, the
spirit of Heinrich Heine is to this very day, how
deeply his satire cuts into questions of religion and
State, how impatient he is of everything which
the German Emperor esteems and venerates in
his innermost heart. But the German people,
on the whole, and certainly all foreigners, have
long ago forgiven the poet, not because they have
understood the dead bard better than the Emperor,
but because they understood him less well.
It is always easier to forgive an offender if you<a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a>
do not understand him too well, it is likewise
easier to forgive him if your memory be short.
And the peoples likewise resemble our womenfolk
in this respect, that as soon as they are widowed
of their poets, they easily forget all the unpleasantness
that had ever existed between them and their
dead husbands. It is then and only then that
they discover the good qualities of their dead
consorts and go about telling everybody "what
a wonderful man he was." Their behaviour
reminds me of a picture I once saw in a French
comic paper. It represented a widow who, in
order to hear her deceased husband's voice,
had a gramophone put at his empty place at the
breakfast table. And every morning she sat
opposite that gramophone weeping quietly into
her handkerchief, gazing mournfully at the
instrument&mdash;decorated with her dead hubby's
tasselled cap&mdash;and listening to the voice of the
dear departed. But the only words which came
out of the gramophone every morning were:</i>
Mais fiche-moi donc la paix&mdash;tu m'empêches
de lire mon journal! <i>(For goodness' sake,
leave me alone and let me read my paper.)<a name="page_9" id="page_9"></a>
This, however, did not appear to disturb the
sentimental widow at all, as little indeed as a
good sentimental people resents being abused by
its dead poet.</i></p>

<p><i>And how our poet did abuse them during his
life! And not only during his life, for Heine
would not have been a great poet if his loves
and hatreds, his censure and his praise had not
outlasted his life, nay, had not come to real life
only after his death. Thus the shafts of wit
and satire which Heine levelled at his age and
his country will seem singularly modern to the
reader of to-day. It is this peculiar modern
significance and application that has been one
of the two reasons for presenting to the English
public the first popular edition of Heine's lyrico-satiric
masterpiece "Atta Troll." The other
reason is the fine quality of the translation,
made by one who is himself well known as a
poet, my friend Herman Scheffauer. I venture
to say that it renders in a remarkable degree
the elusive brilliance, wit, and tenderness of
the German original.</i></p>

<p><i>The poem begins in a sprightly fashion full<a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a>
of airy mockery and romantic lyricism. The
reader is beguiled as with music and led on as
in a dance. Heine himself called it</i> das letzte
freie Waldlied der Romantik <i>("The last free
woodland-song of Romanticism"); and so we
hear the alluring sound of flutes and harps, we
listen to the bells ringing from lonely chapels
in the forest, and many beautiful flowers nod to
us, the mysterious blue flower amongst them.
Then our eyes rejoice at the sight of fair maidens,
whose nude and slender bodies gleam from under
their floods of golden hair, who ride on white
horses and throw us provocative glances, that
warm and quicken our innermost hearts. But
just as we are on the point of responding to their
fond entreaties we are startled by the cracking
of the wild hunter's whip, and we hear the loud
hallo and huzza of his band, and see them
galloping across our path in the eerie mysterious
moonlight. Yes, in "Atta Troll" there is
plenty of that moonshine, of that tender sentimentality,
which used to be the principal stock-in-trade
of the German Romanticist.</i></p>

<p><i>But this moonshine and all the other para<a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a>phernalia
of the Romantic School Heine handled
with all the greater skill, inasmuch as he was no
longer a real Romanticist when he wrote "Atta
Troll." He had left the Romantic School long
ago, not without (as he himself tells us) "having
given a good thrashing to his schoolmaster."
He was now a Greek, a follower of Spinoza and
Goethe. He was a</i> Romantique défroqué&mdash;<i>one
who had risen above his neurotic fellow-poets
and their hazy ideas and wild endeavours. But
for this very reason he is able to use their mode of
expression with so much the greater skill, and,
knowing all their shortcomings, he could give to
his Dreamland a semblance of reality which they
could never achieve. Only after having left a town
are we in a position to judge the height of its
church steeple, only as exiles do we begin to see
the right relation in which our country stands
to the rest of the world, and only a poet who had
bidden farewell to his party and school, who had
freed himself from Romanticism, could give
us the last, the truest, the most beautiful poem of
Romanticism.</i></p>

<p><i>It is possible, even probable, that "Atta<a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a>
Troll" will appeal to a majority of readers, not
through its satire, but through its wonderful
lyrical and romantic qualities&mdash;our age being
inclined to look askance at satire, at least at
true satire, at satire that, as the current phrase
goes, "means business." Weak satire, aimless
satire, humour, caricature&mdash;that is to say satire
which uses blank cartridges&mdash;this age of ours
will readily endure, nay heartily welcome;
but of true satire, of satire that goes in for
powder and shot, that does not only crack, but
kill, it is mortally, and, if one comes to think of
it rightly, afraid. But let even those who object
to powder and shot approach "Atta Troll"
without fear or misgiving. They will not be disappointed.
They will find in this work proof of
the old truth that a satirist is always and originally
a man of high ideals and imagination.
They will gain an insight into his much slandered
soul, which is always that of a great poet. They
will readily understand that this poet only
became a satirist through the vivacity of his
imagination, through the strength of his poetic
vision, through his optimistic belief in humanity<a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a>
and its possibilities; and that it was precisely
this great faith which forced him to become a
satirist, because he could not endure to see all
his pure ideals and the possibilities of perfection
soiled and trampled upon by thoughtless mechanics,
aimless mockers and babbling reformers. The
humorist may be&mdash;and very often is&mdash;a sceptic,
a pessimist, a nihilist; the satirist is invariably
a believer, an optimist, an idealist. For let
this dangerous man only come face to face, not
with his enemies, but with his ideals, and you will
see&mdash;as in "Atta Troll"&mdash;what a generous friend,
what an ardent lover, what a great poet he is.
Thus no one will be in the least disturbed by
Heine's satire: on the contrary, those who
object to it on principle will hardly be aware of
it, so delighted will they be with the wonderful
imagination, the glowing descriptions, and the
passionate lyrics in which the poetry of "Atta
Troll" abounds. The poem may be and will
be read by them as "Gulliver's Travels" is
read to-day by young and old, by poet and
politician alike, not for its original satire, but
for its picturesque, dramatic, and enthralling tale.</i><a name="page_14" id="page_14"></a></p>

<p><i>But let those who still believe that writing is
fighting, and not sham-fighting only, those who
hold that a poet is a soldier of the pen and therefore
the most dangerous of all soldiers, those who feel
that our age needs a hailstorm of satire, let these,
I say, look closer at the wonderfully ideal figures
that pass before them in the pale mysterious
light. Let them listen more intently to the
flutes and harps and they will discover quite a
different melody beneath&mdash;a melody by no means
bewitching or soothing, nor inviting us to dreams,
sweet forgetfulness, soft couches, and tender
embraces, but a shrill and mocking tune that is
at times insolently discordant and that strikes
us as decidedly modern, realistic, and threatening.
As the poet himself expressed it in his dedication
to Varnhagen von Ense:</i></p>

<p class="poem">
"<i>Aye, my friend, such strains arise</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>From the dream-time that is dead</i></span><br />
Though some modern trills may oft<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Caper through the ancient theme.</span><br />
<br />
"Spite of waywardness thou'lt find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here and there a note of pain...."</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Let their ears seek to catch these painful
notes. Let their eyes accustom themselves to
the deceitful light of the moon; let them
endeavour to pierce through the romanticism
on the surface to the underlying meaning of the
poem.... A little patience and we shall see
clearly....</i></p>

<p><i>Atta Troll, the dancing bear, is the representative
of the people. He has&mdash;by means of
the French Revolution, of course&mdash;broken his
fetters and escaped to the freedom of the mountains.
Here he indulges in that familiar ranting
of a</i> sansculotte, <i>his heart and mouth brimming
over with what Heine calls</i> frecher Gleichheitsschwindel
<i>("the barefaced swindle of equality").
His hatred is above all directed against the
masters from whose bondage he has just escaped,
that is to say against all mankind as a race. As
a "true and noble bear" he simply detests
these human beings with their superior airs and
impudent smiles, those arrogant wretches, who
fancy themselves something lofty, because they
eat cooked meat and know a few tricks and
sciences. Animals, if properly trained, if only<a name="page_16" id="page_16"></a>
equality of opportunity were given to them,
could learn these tricks just as well&mdash;there is
therefore no earthly reason why</i></p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>"these men,</i></span><br />
<i>Cursèd arch-aristocrats,</i><br />
<i>Should with haughty insolence</i><br />
<i>Look upon the world of beasts."</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>The beasts, so Atta Troll declares, ought not
to allow themselves to be treated in this wise.
They ought to combine amongst themselves, for
it is only by means of proper union that the
requisite degree of strength can ever be attained.
After the establishment of this powerful union
they should try to enforce their programme and
demand the abolition of private property and of
human privileges:</i></p>

<p class="poem">
<i>"And its first great law shall be</i><br />
<i>For God's creatures one and all</i><br />
<i>Equal rights&mdash;no matter what</i><br />
<i>Be their faith, or hide, or smell,</i><a name="page_17" id="page_17"></a><br />
<br />
<i>"Strict equality! Each ass</i><br />
<i>May become Prime Minister,</i><br />
<i>On the other hand the lion</i><br />
<i>Shall bear corn unto the mill."</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>This outrageous diatribe of the freed slave cuts
deeply into the poet's heart. He, the poet, does
not believe in equal, but in the "holy inborn"
rights of men, the rights of valid birth, the rights
of the man of &#7937;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#7969;. He, the poet, the
admirer of Napoleon, believes in the latter's</i>
la carrière ouverte aux talents, <i>but not in
opportunity given to every dunce or dancing
bear. He holds Atta Troll's opinion to be
"high treason against the majesty of humanity,"
and since he can endure this no longer, he sets
out one fine morning to hunt the insolent bear in
his mountain fastnesses.</i></p>

<p><i>A strange being, however, accompanies him.
This is a man of the name of Lascaro, a somewhat
abnormal fellow, who is very thin, very pale,
and apparently in very poor health. He is
consequently not exactly a pleasant comrade
for the chase: he does not seem to enjoy the<a name="page_18" id="page_18"></a>
sport at all, and his one endeavour is to get
through with his task without losing more of his
strength and health. Even now he is more of an
automaton than a human being, more dead than
alive, and yet&mdash;greatest of all miseries!&mdash;he is
not allowed to die. For he has a mother, the
witch Uraka, who keeps him artificially alive by
anointing him every night with magic salve and
giving him such diabolic advice as will be useful
to him during the day. By means of the sham
health she gives to her son, the magic bullets she
casts for him, the tricks and wiles she teaches him,
Lascaro is enabled to find the track of Atta
Troll, to lure him out of his lair and to lay him
low with a treacherous shot.</i></p>

<p><i>Who is this silent Lascaro and his mysterious
mother, whom the poet seems to hold in as slight
regard as the noisy Atta Troll? Who is this
Lascaro, whose methods he deprecates, whose
health he doubts, whose cold ways and icy smiles
make him shudder? Who is this chilliest of all
monsters? The chilliest of all monsters&mdash;we may
find the answer in "Zarathustra"&mdash;is the
State: and our Lascaro is nothing else than the<a name="page_19" id="page_19"></a>
spirit of reactionary government, kept artificially
alive by his old witch-mother, the spirit
of Feudalism. The nightly anointing of Lascaro
is a parody on the revival of mediæval customs,
by means of which the frightened aristocracy of
Europe in the middle of the last century tried
to stem the tide of the French Revolution&mdash;the
anointed of the Lord becoming in Heine's poem
the anointed of the witch. But in spite of his
nightly massage, our Lascaro does not gain
much strength or spirit: no mediæval salves,
no feudal pills, no witch's spell, will ever cure him.
Not even a wizard's experiments (we may add,
with that greater insight bestowed upon us by
history) could do him any good, not even the
astute magic tricks that were lavished upon the
patient in Heine's time by that arch wizard, the
Austrian Minister Metternich. For we must
not forget the time in which "Atta Troll" was
written, the time of the omnipotent Metternich!
Let us recall to our memories this cool, clever,
callous statesman, who founded and set the
Holy Alliance against the Revolution, who
calmly shot down the German Atta Troll, who<a name="page_20" id="page_20"></a>
skilfully strangled and stifled that promising
poetical school, "Young Germany," to which
Heine belonged. Let us recall this man, who
likewise artificially revived the old religion and
the old feudalism, who repolished and regilded
the scutcheons of the decadent aristocracy, and
who, despite all his energy, had at heart no belief
in his work, no joy in his task, no faith in the
anointed dummies he brought to life again in
Europe&mdash;and those puzzling personalities of
Uraka and Lascaro will be elucidated to us by
a real historical example.</i></p>

<p><i>Metternich is now part of history. But, alas!
we cannot likewise banish into that limbo of the
past those two superfluous individuals, the revolutionary
Atta Troll and the reactionary
Lascaro. Alas! we cannot join the joyful, but
inwardly so hopeless, band of those who sing the
pæan of eternal progress, who pretend to believe
that the times are always "changing for the
better." Let these good people open their eyes,
and they will see that Atta Troll was not shot
down in the valley of Roncesvalles, but that he
is still alive, very much alive, and making a<a name="page_21" id="page_21"></a>
dreadful noise, and that not in the Pyrenees, but
just outside our doors, where he still keeps
haranguing about equality and liberty and
occasionally breaks his fetters and escapes from
his masters. And when this occurs, then that icy
monster Lascaro is likewise seen, with his hard,
pallid face and his joyless mouth, and his disgust
with his own task and his doubts and disbeliefs in
himself. He still carries his gun and he still
possesses some of that craftiness which his mother
the witch has taught him, and he still knows how
to entrap that poor, stupid Atta Troll, and to
shoot him down when the spirit of "order and
government," the spirit of a soulless capitalism,
requires it.</i></p>

<p><i>No, there is very little feeling in the man as
yet, and he seems as difficult to move as ever.
There is apparently only one thing that can rouse
him into action, and that is when a poet appears,
one who knows the truth and who dares to speak
the truth not only about Atta Troll, the people,
but also about its Lascaros, its leaders, its
emperors, and kings. Then and then only
his hard features change, and his affected self-<a name="page_22" id="page_22"></a>possession
leaves him, then and then only his
mask of calmness is thrown off, and he waxes
very angry with the poet, and has his name
banished from his court and his statues turned
out of his cities and villas&mdash;nay, he would even
level his gun to slay the truth-telling poet as
he slew Atta Troll.</i></p>

<p><i>From which we may see that the modern
Lascaro has become a sort of Don Quixote&mdash;for,
truly is it not the height of folly for a mortal
emperor to shoot at an immortal poet?</i></p>

<p class="notes"><i>"ATTA TROLL" was composed in the late
autumn of 1841, and appeared as a fragment in</i>
The Elegant World, <i>of which my friend Laube
had at that time resumed the editorship. The
shape and contents of the poem were forced to
conform to the narrow necessities of that periodical.
I wrote at first only those cantos which might be
printed and even these suffered many variations.
It was my intention to issue the work later in
its full completeness, but this commendable
resolve remained unfulfilled&mdash;like all the mighty
works of the Germans&mdash;such as the cathedral of
Cologne, the God of Schelling, the Prussian
Constitution, and the like. This also happened
to "Atta Troll"&mdash;he was never finished. In
such imperfect form, indifferently bolstered up
and rounded only from without, do I now set
him before the public, obedient to an impulse
which certainly does not proceed from within.</i></p>

<p><i>"Atta Troll," as I have said, originated in
the late autumn of 1841, at the time when<a name="page_26" id="page_26"></a>
the great mob which my enemies of various
complexions, had drummed together against me,
had not quite ceased its noise. It was a very
large mob and indeed I would never have
believed that Germany could produce so many
rotten apples as then flew about my head!
Our Fatherland is a blessed country! Citrons
and oranges certainly do not grow here, and the
laurel ekes out but a miserable existence, but
rotten apples thrive in the happiest abundance,
and never a great poet of ours but could write
feelingly of them! On the occasion of that
hue and cry in which I was to lose both my head
and my laurels it happened that I lost neither.
All the absurd accusations which were used to
incite the mob against me have since then been
miserably annihilated, even without my condescending
to refute them. Time justified me,
and the various German States have even, as I
must most gratefully acknowledge, done me
good service in this respect. The warrants of
arrest which at every German station past the
frontier await the return of this poet, are
thoroughly renovated every year during the holy<a name="page_27" id="page_27"></a>
Christmastide, when the little candles glow
merrily on the Christmas trees. It is this
insecurity of the roads which has almost destroyed
my pleasure in travelling through the German
meads. I am therefore celebrating my Christmas
in an alien land, and it will be as an exile in a
foreign country that I shall end my days.</i></p>

<p><i>But those valiant champions of Light and
Truth who accuse me of fickleness and servility,
are able to go about quite securely in the Fatherland&mdash;as
well-stalled servants of the State, as
dignitaries of a Guild, or as regular guests of a
club where of evenings they may regale themselves
with the vinous juices of Father Rhine
and with "sea-surrounded Schleswig-Holstein"
oysters.</i></p>

<p><i>It was my express intention to indicate in the
foregoing at what period "Atta Troll" was
written. At that time the so-called art of
political poetry was in full flower. The opposition,
as Ruge says, sold its leather and became
poetry. The Muses were given strict orders
that they were thenceforth no longer to gad about
in a wanton, easy-going fashion, but would be<a name="page_28" id="page_28"></a>
compelled to enter into national service, possibly
as</i> vivandières <i>of liberty or as washerwomen of
Christian-Germanic nationalism. Especially
were the bowers of the German bards afflicted
by that vague and sterile pathos, that useless
fever of enthusiasm which, with absolute disregard
for death, plunges itself into an ocean of
generalities. This always reminds me of the
American sailor who was so madly enthusiastic
over General Jackson that he sprang from the
mast-head into the sea, crying out: "I die for
General Jackson!" Yes, even though we
Germans as yet possessed no fleet, still we had
plenty of sailors who were willing to die for
General Jackson, in prose or verse. In those
days talent was a rather questionable gift, for
it brought one under suspicion of being a loose
character. After thousands of years of grubbing
deliberation, Impotence, sick and limping Impotence,
at last discovered its greatest weapon
against the over-encouragement of genius&mdash;it
discovered, in fact, the antithesis between Talent
and Character. It was almost personally
flattering to the great masses when they heard it<a name="page_29" id="page_29"></a>
said that good, average people were certainly
poor musicians as a rule, but that, on the other
hand, fine musicians were not usually good people&mdash;that
goodness was the important thing in this
world and not music. Empty-Head now beat
resolutely upon his full Heart, and Sentiment
was trumps. I recall an author of that day who
accounted his inability to write as a peculiar
merit in himself, and who, because of his wooden
style, was given a silver cup of honour.</i></p>

<p><i>By the eternal gods! at that time it became
necessary to defend the inalienable rights of the
spirit, above all in poetry. Inasmuch as I
have made this defence the chief business of my
life, I have kept it constantly before me in this
poem whose tone and theme are both a protest
against the plebiscite of the tribunes of the times.
And verily, even the first fragments of "Atta
Troll" which saw the light, aroused the wrath
of my heroic worthies, my dear Romans, who
accused me not only of a literary but also of a
social reaction, and even of mocking the loftiest
human ideals. As to the esthetic worth of my
poem&mdash;of that I thought but little, as I still do<a name="page_30" id="page_30"></a>
to-day&mdash;I wrote it solely for my own joy and
pleasure, in the fanciful dreamy manner of that
romantic school in which I whiled away my
happiest years of youth, and then wound up by
thrashing the schoolmaster. Possibly in this
regard my poem is to be condemned. But thou
liest, Brutus, thou too, Cassius, and even thou,
Asinius, when ye declare that my mockery is
levelled against those ideals which constitute
the noble achievements of man, for which I
too have wrought and suffered so much. No, it
is just because the poet constantly sees these
ideas before him in all their clarity and greatness
that he is forced into irresistible laughter when he
beholds how raw, awkward, and clumsy these
ideas may appear when interpreted by a narrow
circle of contemporary spirits. Then perforce
must he jest about their thick temporal hides&mdash;bear
hides. There are mirrors which are ground
in so irregular a way that even an Apollo would
behold himself as a caricature in them, and invite
laughter. But we do not laugh at the god
but merely at his distorted image.</i></p>

<p><i>Another word. Need I lay any special<a name="page_31" id="page_31"></a>
emphasis upon the fact that the parodying of
one of Freiligrath's poems, which here and there
somewhat saucily titters from the lines of "Atta
Troll," in no wise constitutes a disparagement
of that poet? I value him highly, especially
at present, and account him one of the most
important poets who have arisen in Germany
since the Revolution of 1830. His first collection
of poems came to my notice rather late, namely
just at the time when I was composing "Atta
Troll." The fact that the Moorish Prince
affected me so comically was no doubt due to my
particular mood at that time. Moreover, this
work of his is usually vaunted as his best. To
such readers as may not be acquainted with this
production&mdash;and I doubt not such may be found
in China and Japan, and even along the banks
of the Niger and Senegal&mdash;I would call attention
to the fact that the Blackamoor King, who at
the beginning of the poem steps from his white
tent like an eclipsed moon, is beloved by a black
beauty over whose dusky features nod white
ostrich plumes. But, eager for war, he leaves
her, and enters into the battles of the blacks,<a name="page_32" id="page_32"></a>
"where rattles the drum decorated with skulls,"
but, alas! here he finds his black Waterloo, and
is sold by the victors unto the whites. They
take the noble African to Europe and here we
find him in a company of itinerant circus folk
who intrust him with the care of the Turkish
drum at their performances. There he stands,
dark and solemn, at the entrance to the ring,
and drums. But as he drums he thinks of his
erstwhile greatness, remembers, too, that he was
once an absolute monarch on the far, far banks of
the Niger, that he hunted lions and tigers:</i></p>

Stiff with pride and gravity<br />

I am even fain to think<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Holding her with loosened chain,</span><br />
Marks the immorality<br />

<br />
So at times he lays the lash<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straight across her inky back,</span><br />
Till the mountains wake and shout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Echoes to her frenzied howls.</span><br />

On the showman's pointed hat<br />

Worse and worse! for money vile<br />

And he scowls as scowled the black<br />

Beat upon his mighty drum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the drumskin crashed and broke&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Thrilling must that crash have been&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Likewise hard upon the ear&mdash;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cease. What yells of fear arise!</span><br />
From the square the people rush<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the gentle dames grow pale.</span><br />
<br />
Yea, from all his slavish bonds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Atta Troll has torn him free.</span><br />
Suddenly! With mighty leaps<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the narrow streets he runs.<a name="page_41" id="page_41"></a></span><br />
<br />
Room enough is his, I trow!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up the jagged cliffs he climbs,</span><br />
Flings down one contemptuous look,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then is lost within the hills.</span><br />
<br />
Lone within the market-place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mumma and her master stand&mdash;</span><br />
Raging, now he grasps his hat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cursing, casts it on the earth,</span><br />
<br />
Tramples on it, kicks and flouts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Madonnas, tears the cloak</span><br />
Off his foul and naked back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yells and blasphemes horribly</span><br />
<br />
'Gainst the base ingratitude<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the race of sable bears.</span><br />
Had he not been kind to Troll?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Taught him dancing free of charge?</span><br />
<br />
Everything this monster owed him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even life. For some had bid,</span><br />
All in vain! three hundred marks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the hide of Atta Troll.<a name="page_42" id="page_42"></a></span><br />
<br />
Like some carven form of grief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There the poor black Mumma stands</span><br />
On her hind feet, with her paws<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pleading with the raging clown.</span><br />
<br />
But on her the raging clown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looses now his twofold wrath;</span><br />
Beats her; calls her Queen Christine,<br />

All this happened on a fair<br />

And the night which followed, ah!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was superb and wonderful.</span><br />
<br />
Of that night a part I spent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a small white balcony;</span><br />
Juliet was at my side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we viewed the passing stars.</span><br />
<br />
"Fairer far," she sighed, "the stars<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the mother-tongue he raves,</span><br />
Scorning all the senseless jargon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Romans and the Greeks.</span><br />
<br />
"Fresh and pious, gay and free,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hating all that smacks of soap</span><br />
Or the modern craze for baths&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Verily like Massmann too!</span><br />
<br />
Most inspired is this youth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he clambers up the tree</span><br />
Which from out the hollow gorge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rears itself along the cliff,<a name="page_48" id="page_48"></a></span><br />
<br />
Rears and lifts unto the crest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where at night this jolly band</span><br />
Squat and loll about their sire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the twilight dim and cool.</span><br />
<br />
Gladly there the father bear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tells them stories of the world,</span><br />
Of strange cities and their folk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of all he suffered too,</span><br />
<br />
Suffered like Ulysses great&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Differing slightly from this brave</span><br />
Since his black Penelope<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never parted from his side.</span><br />

Loudly too prates Atta Troll<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the mighty meed of praise</span><br />
Which by practice of his art<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He had wrung from humankind.</span><br />
<br />
Young and old, so runs his tale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cheered in wonder and in joy,</span><br />
When in market-squares he danced<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the bag-pipe's pleasant skirl.<a name="page_49" id="page_49"></a></span><br />
<br />
And the ladies most of all&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, what gentle connoisseurs!&mdash;</span><br />
Rendered him their mad applause<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And full many a tender glance.</span><br />
<br />
Artists' vanity! Alas,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pensively the dancing-bear</span><br />
Thinks upon those happy hours<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When his talents pleased the crowd.</span><br />
<br />
Seized with rapture self-inspired,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He would prove his words by deeds,</span><br />
Prove himself no boaster vain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But a master in the art.</span><br />
<br />
Swiftly from the ground he springs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stands on hinder paws erect,</span><br />
Dances then his favourite dance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As of old&mdash;the great Gavotte.</span><br />
<br />
Dumb, with open jaws the cubs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gaze upon their father there</span><br />
As he makes his wondrous leaps<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the moonshine to and fro.</span><br />

Break a path at dead of night<br />

It is Atta Troll the Sire,<br />

Slaughtered wretched human wights<br />

<br />
Like to sleepy dancing-girls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lift the mountains white and cold,</span><br />
Standing in their skirts of mist<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flaunted by the winds of morn.</span><br />
<br />
Yet full soon their breasts shall glow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the sun-god's burning kiss,</span><br />
He shall tear the clinging veils<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And illume their beauty nude.</span><br />
<br />
In the early dawn had I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Lascaro sallied forth</span><br />
On a bear-hunt and the noon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saw us at the Pont d'Espagne.</span><br />
<br />
Thus is named the bridge that leads<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the land of France to Spain,</span><br />
To barbarians of the West,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Centuries behind the times.<a name="page_75" id="page_75"></a></span><br />
<br />
Full ten centuries they lie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From all modern thought removed,</span><br />
And my own barbarians<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the East&mdash;not more than two.</span><br />
<br />
Lingering and loth I left<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The all-hallowed soil of France,</span><br />
Left great Freedom's motherland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the women that I love.</span><br />
<br />
Midmost of the Pont d'Espagne<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sat a Spaniard. Misery</span><br />
Lurked within his tattered cape;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Misery lurked within his eyes.</span><br />
<br />
With his bony fingers he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plucked an ancient mandolin</span><br />
Full of discord shrill which echoed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mockingly from out the gulch.</span><br />
<br />
Then betimes he leaned aslant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the depths and laughed aloud,</span><br />
Tinkled then in maddest wise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he sang his little song:<a name="page_76" id="page_76"></a></span><br />
<br />
"In my very heart of heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's a tiny golden table,</span><br />
And about this golden table<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Four small golden chairs are set.</span><br />
<br />
"Seated on these golden chairs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little dames with darts of gold</span><br />
In their hair are playing cards&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clara wins at every game.</span><br />
<br />
"Yes, she wins and smiles in glee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clara, oh, within my heart,</span><br />
Thou can'st never fail to win,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For thou holdest all the trumps!"</span><br />
<br />
On I wandered and I spoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus unto myself. How strange!</span><br />
Lunacy itself sits there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Singing on the road to Spain.</span><br />
<br />
Is this madman not a sign<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of how nations trade in thought?</span><br />
Or is he his native land's<br />

Where <i>podrida</i>&mdash;favourite dish!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Steamed within a dirty pot.</span><br />
<br />
There <i>garbanzos</i> did I eat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Huge and hard as musket-balls,</span><br />
Which not e'en a native Teuton,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bred on dumplings, could digest.</span><br />
<br />
And my bed was of a piece,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the cooking. Insects vile</span><br />
Dotted it. Oh, surely these<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are the grimmest foes of man!</span><br />
<br />
Far more fearful than the wrath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a thousand elephants,</span><br />

How they do protest that Nature<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is a mighty fane of God!</span><br />
<br />
One great fane whose splendours all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Maker's glory tell;</span><br />
Sun and moon and stars they vow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hang as lamps within the dome.</span><br />
<br />
Yet concede, most worthy folk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That this mighty temple hath</span><br />
Most uncomfortable stairs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stairs most villainously bad!</span><br />
<br />
All this climbing up and down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Escalading, jumping o'er</span><br />
Boulders&mdash;how it tires me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Both in spirit and in legs!<a name="page_80" id="page_80"></a></span><br />

By my side Lascaro strode,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a taper long and pale&mdash;</span><br />
Never speaks he, never laughs&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He the witch's lifeless son.</span><br />
<br />
For they say Lascaro died<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Many years ago&mdash;his mother's,&mdash;</span><br />
Old Uraka's,&mdash;magic draughts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gave to him a seeming life.</span><br />
<br />
These confounded temple steps!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How it chanced that I escaped</span><br />
With whole vertebræ will puzzle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Me until my dying day.</span><br />
<br />
How the torrents foamed and roared!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the pines how lashed the wind</span><br />
Till they groaned! Then suddenly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burst the clouds! O weather vile!</span><br />
<br />
In a fisherman's poor hut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Close by Lac de Gaube we gained</span><br />
Shelter and a mess of trout&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dish divine and glorious!<a name="page_81" id="page_81"></a></span><br />
<br />
In his padded arm-chair there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sat the ancient ferryman,</span><br />
Ill and grey. His nieces sweet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like two angels tended him.</span><br />
<br />
Plumpest angels, Flemish quite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if out of Rubens' frame</span><br />
They had leaped, with golden locks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sparkling eyes of limpid blue,</span><br />
<br />
Dimples in each ruddy cheek<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where bright mischief peered and hid,</span><br />
And with limbs robust and lithe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Waking both desire and fear.</span><br />
<br />
Sweet and bonny creatures they<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who disputed prettily</span><br />
Which might prove the sweetest draught<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To their ancient, ailing charge.</span><br />
<br />
If one proffers him a brew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made of linden-flower tea,</span><br />
Then the other tempts him with<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Possets made of elder-blooms.<a name="page_82" id="page_82"></a></span><br />
<br />
"I will swallow none of this!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cried the greyhead, sorely tried,</span><br />
"Bring me wine so that my guest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May have worthy drink with me!"</span><br />
<br />
If this stuff was really wine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I drank at Lac de Gaube&mdash;</span><br />
Who can tell? My countrymen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would have dubbed it sweetish beer.</span><br />
<br />
Vilely smelled the wine-skin too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fashioned from a black goat's hide.</span><br />
But the old man drank and drank<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And grew jubilant and gay.</span><br />
<br />
Of banditti tales he told<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of smugglers, merry men</span><br />
Who still ply their goodly trades<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Freely in the Pyrenees.</span><br />
<br />
Many ancient stories, too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He recited, as of wars</span><br />
'Twixt the giants and the bears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the grey primeval days.<a name="page_83" id="page_83"></a></span><br />
<br />
For it seems the bears and ogres<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Waged a war for mastery</span><br />
Of these ranges and these vales<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long ere man came wandering in.</span><br />
<br />
Startled then at sight of men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the giants fled the land;&mdash;</span><br />
Only tiny brains were housed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In their huge, unwieldy heads!</span><br />
<br />
It is also said these dolts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they reached the ocean-shore</span><br />
Where the azure skies lay glassed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the watery plains below,</span><br />
<br />
Fondly fancied that the sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must be Heaven. In they plunged</span><br />
All in reckless confidence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in watery graves were gulfed.</span><br />
<br />
Now the bears are slain by man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And each year their number grows</span><br />
Smaller, smaller, till at last<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">None shall roam within the hills.<a name="page_84" id="page_84"></a></span><br />
<br />
"And," the old man cackled, "thus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On this Earth must one yield room</span><br />
To the other&mdash;after man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We shall have a reign of dwarfs.</span><br />
<br />
"Tiny and most clever wights<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toiling in the bowels of Earth,</span><br />
Busy little folk that gather<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Riches from Earth's golden veins.</span><br />
<br />
"I have seen their rounded heads<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peering out of rabbit-holes</span><br />
In the moonlight&mdash;and I shook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I thought of coming days.</span><br />
<br />
"Yes, I dread the golden power<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of these mites. Our sons, I fear,</span><br />
Will like stupid giants plunge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straight into some watery heaven."</span><br />

Swift and blithe they row. Their arms<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leaps and blazes, glows and sings.</span><br />
<br />
And these girls who swing their oars<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Merrily, and splash me too,</span><br />
Laugh and grin with mischief rare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the drops upon me flash.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, these wenches fresh and strong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Surely they could never be</span><br />
Ghostly hell-cats, nor the maids<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the dark queen Proserpine.<a name="page_87" id="page_87"></a></span><br />
<br />
So that I might be assured<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the girls' reality,</span><br />
And unto myself might prove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My own honest flesh and blood,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
On their rosy dimples I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swiftly pressed my eager lips,</span><br />
And to this conclusion came:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lo, I kiss; therefore I live!</span><br />
<br />
When we reached the shore, again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did I kiss these bonny maids,&mdash;</span><br />
Kisses were the only coin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which in payment they would take.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
Joyous in the golden air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lift the purple mountain heights</span><br />
Where a daring hamlet clings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a nest against the steep.</span><br />
<br />
Wearily I climbed and climbed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When at last I stood aloft,</span><br />
Then I found the old birds flown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the fledglings left behind.</span><br />
<br />
Pretty lads and lassies small<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With their little heads half hid</span><br />
In their white and scarlet caps,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Played at bridals in the mart.</span><br />
<br />
Neither stay nor halt they brooked,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the little love-lorn Prince</span><br />
Of the Mice knelt down at once<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the Cat-King's daughter fair.<a name="page_89" id="page_89"></a></span><br />
<br />
Hapless Prince! At last he's wed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the Princess. How she scolds!</span><br />
Bites him and devours him&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hapless mouse!&mdash;thus ends the play.</span><br />
<br />
That entire day I spent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the children, and we talked</span><br />
Cosily. They longed to know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who I was? and what my trade?</span><br />
<br />
"Germany, my dears," I spoke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Is my native country's name&mdash;</span><br />
Bears are all too common there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So I took to hunting bears!</span><br />
<br />
"Many a bear-pelt have I pulled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over many a bearish head,</span><br />
Though, 'tis true, I sometimes got<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Damage from their bearish paws.</span><br />
<br />
"But at last I felt disgust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of this strife with ill-licked boors</span><br />
In my blessèd land&mdash;I grew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weary of these daily moils.<a name="page_90" id="page_90"></a></span><br />
<br />
"So in quest of nobler game,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I at last have come to you;</span><br />
I shall try my little strength<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Gainst the mighty Atta Troll.</span><br />
<br />
"Worthy of me is this noble<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Foe. In Germany, alas!</span><br />
Many a battle did I win,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most ashamed of victory."</span><br />
<br />
When I left, the little folk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Danced about me in a ring,</span><br />
And in sweetest wise they sang:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Girofflino! Girofflett'!"</span><br />
<br />
And the youngest of them all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stepped before me quick and pert,</span><br />
And four times she curtsied low<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As she sang in silver tones:</span><br />
<br />
"Curtsies two I give the King,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should I meet him. And the Queen,</span><br />
Should I meet her, then I give<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Curtsies three unto the Queen.<a name="page_91" id="page_91"></a></span><br />
<br />
"But should I the devil meet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his fiery eyes and horns,</span><br />
I will make him curtsies four&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Girofflino! Girofflett'!"</span><br />
<br />
"Girofflino! Girofflett'!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shouts once more the mocking band,</span><br />
And around me swings the gay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ring-o'-roses with its song.</span><br />
<br />
As I scrambled down the slopes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">After me in echoes sweet,</span><br />
Came these words in bird-like strains:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Girofflino! Girofflett'!"</span><br />

Hulking and enormous cliffs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of deformed and twisted shapes</span><br />
Look on me like petrified<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Monsters of primeval times.</span><br />
<br />
Strange! the dingy clouds above<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drift like doubles bred of mist,</span><br />
Like some silly counterfeit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of these savage shapes of stone.</span><br />
<br />
In the distance roars the fall;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the fir trees howls the wind!</span><br />
'Tis a sound implacable<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as fatal as despair.</span><br />
<br />
Lone and dreadful lies the waste<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the black daws sit in swarms</span><br />
On the bleached and rotten pines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flapping with their weary wings.<a name="page_93" id="page_93"></a></span><br />
<br />
At my side Lascaro strides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pale and silent&mdash;I myself</span><br />
Must like sorry madness look<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By dire Death accompanied.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis a wild and desert place.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Curst perchance? I seem to see</span><br />
On the crippled roots of yonder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tree a crimson smear of blood.</span><br />
<br />
This tree shades a little hut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cowering humbly in the earth,</span><br />
And the wretched roof of thatch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pleads for pity in your sight.</span><br />
<br />
Cagots are the denizens<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of this hut&mdash;the last remains</span><br />
Of a tribe which sunk in darkness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bides its bitter destiny.</span><br />
<br />
In the heart of every Basque<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You will find a rooted hate</span><br />
Of the Cagots. 'Tis a foul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Relic of the days of faith.<a name="page_94" id="page_94"></a></span><br />
<br />
In the minster at Bagnères<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You may see a narrow grille,</span><br />
Once the door, the sexton told me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which the herded Cagots used.</span><br />
<br />
In that day all other gates<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were forbidden them. They crawled</span><br />
Like to thieves into the blest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">House of God to worship there.</span><br />
<br />
There these wretched beings sat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On their lowly stools and prayed,</span><br />
Parted as by leprosy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From all other worshippers.</span><br />
<br />
But the hallowed lamps of this<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Later century burn bright,</span><br />
And their light destroys the black<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shadows of that cruel age!</span><br />
<br />
While Lascaro waited there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Entered I the lonely hut</span><br />
Of the Cagot, and I clasped<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straight his hand in brotherhood.<a name="page_95" id="page_95"></a></span><br />
<br />
Likewise did I kiss his child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which unto the shrivelled breast</span><br />
Of his wife clung fast and sucked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like some spider sick and starved.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
Shouldst thou see these mountain peaks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the distance thou wouldst think</span><br />
That with gold and purple they<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flamed in splendour to the sun.</span><br />
<br />
But at closer hand their pomp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vanishes. Earth's glories thus</span><br />
With their myriad light-effects<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still beguile us artfully.</span><br />
<br />
What to thee seemed blue and gold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is, alas, but idle snow,</span><br />
Idle snow which, lone and drear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bores itself in solitude.</span><br />
<br />
There upon the heights I heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How the hapless crackling snow</span><br />
Cried aloud its pallid grief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the cold and heartless wind:<a name="page_97" id="page_97"></a></span><br />
<br />
"Ah," it sobbed, "how slow the hours<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crawl within this awful waste!</span><br />
All these many endless hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like eternities of ice!</span><br />
<br />
"Woe is me, poor snow! I would<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I had never seen these peaks&mdash;</span><br />
Might I but in vales have fallen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where a myriad flowers bloom!</span><br />
<br />
"To some little brook would I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then have melted, and some maid&mdash;</span><br />
Fairest of the land! with smiles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would in me have laved her face.</span><br />
<br />
"Yea, perchance, I might have fared<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the sea and changed betimes</span><br />
To a pearl and gleamed at last<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In some royal coronet!"</span><br />
<br />
When I heard this plaint, I spake:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Dearest Snow, indeed I doubt</span><br />
Whether such a brilliant fate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had been thine within the world.<a name="page_98" id="page_98"></a></span><br />
<br />
"Comfort take. Few, few, indeed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ever grow to pearls. No doubt</span><br />
Thou hadst fallen in the mire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And become a clod of mud."</span><br />
<br />
As in kindly wise I spoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus unto the joyless snow,</span><br />
Came a shot&mdash;and from the skies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plunged a hawk of brownish wing.</span><br />
<br />
It was just a hunter's joke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Lascaro's. But his face</span><br />
Was as ever stark and grim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his rifle barrel smoked.</span><br />
<br />
Silently he tore a plume<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the hawk's erected tail,</span><br />
Stuck it in his pointed hat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And resumed his silent way.</span><br />
<br />
'Twas an eerie sight to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How his shadow black and thin</span><br />
With the nodding feather moved<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the slopes of drifted snow.</span><br />

Lo, a valley like a street!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis the Hollow Way of Ghosts:</span><br />
Dizzily the cloven crags<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tower up on every side.</span><br />
<br />
There upon the sheerest slope<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hangs Uraka's little shack</span><br />
Like some outpost over chaos&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thither fared her son and I.</span><br />
<br />
In a secret dumb-show speech<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He took counsel with his dam,</span><br />
How great Atta Troll might best<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be ensnared and safely slain.</span><br />
<br />
We had found his mighty spoor.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never more canst thou escape</span><br />
From our hands! thine earthly days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All are numbered&mdash;Atta Troll!<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a></span><br />
<br />
Never could I well determine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If Uraka, ancient hag,</span><br />
Was in truth a potent witch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As within these Pyrenees</span><br />
<br />
It was rumoured. But I know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That in truth her very looks</span><br />
Were suspicious. Most suspicious<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were her red and running eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Evil is her look and slant.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is said whene'er she stares</span><br />
At some hapless cow, its milk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dries, its udder withers straight.</span><br />
<br />
It is said that stroking with<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her thin fingers, many a kid</span><br />
She had slaughtered, many a huge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ox had stricken unto death.</span><br />
<br />
Oft within the local court<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For such crimes arraigned she stood,</span><br />
But the Justice of the Peace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was a true Voltairean.<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a></span><br />
<br />
Quite a modern worldling he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shallow and devoid of faith,&mdash;</span><br />
So the plaintiffs he dismissed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Both in mockery and scorn.</span><br />
<br />
The alleged official trade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Uraka's honest quite,</span><br />
For she deals in mountain-herbs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in birds that she has stuffed.</span><br />
<br />
Her entire hut was crammed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With such relics. Horrible</span><br />
Was the smell of cuckoo-flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fungi, henbane, elder-blooms.</span><br />
<br />
There a fine array of hawks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To advantage was displayed,</span><br />
All with pinions stretching wide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with grim enormous bills.</span><br />
<br />
Was it but the breath of these<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Maddening plants that turned my brain?</span><br />
Still the vision of these birds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Filled me with the strangest thoughts.<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a></span><br />
<br />
These perchance are mortal wights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bound by sorcery in this</span><br />
Miserable state as birds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stuffed and most disconsolate.</span><br />
<br />
Sad, pathetic is their stare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet it hath impatience too,</span><br />
And, methinks at times they cast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sidelong glances at the witch.</span><br />
<br />
She, Uraka, ancient, grim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crouches low beside her son,</span><br />
Mute Lascaro near the fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the twain are casting slugs.</span><br />
<br />
Casting that same fateful ball<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereby Atta Troll was slain.</span><br />
How the lurching firelight flares<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the witch's features gaunt!</span><br />
<br />
Ceaselessly, yet silently<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Move her thin and quivering lips.</span><br />
Are those magic spells she murmurs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the balls may travel true?<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a></span><br />
<br />
Now and then she nods and titters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To her son. But he is deep</span><br />
In the business of the casts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sits silently as Death.</span><br />
<br />
Overcome by fevered fears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yearning for the cooler air,</span><br />
To the window then I strode<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And looked down the gulches dim.</span><br />
<br />
All that in that midnight hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I beheld, all that will I</span><br />
Faithfully and featly tell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the canto that shall follow.</span><br />

From the window of Uraka's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little cabin I could see</span><br />
All that mighty host of wraiths<br />

Yea, a goodly place was mine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherefrom I might well behold</span><br />
The tremendous spectacle<br />

<br />
Cracking whips, hallo! hurrah!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Neigh of horses, bark of dogs,</span><br />
Laughter, blare of huntsmen's horns&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How the tumult echoed there!<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a></span><br />
<br />
Dashing in advance there came<br />

In a solid pack; behind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Charged a wild and merry rout.</span><br />

Huntsmen come from many zones<br />

Charles the Tenth rode close beside<br />

High upon their snowy steeds<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To some mighty frog forsooth!<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a></span><br />
<br />
Many a hero I beheld<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the gleaming world of thought;</span><br />
Wolfgang Goethe straight I knew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the sparkling of his eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Being damned by Hengstenberg,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his grave no peace he finds,</span><br />
So with pagan blazonry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gallops down the chase of Life.</span><br />
<br />
By the glamour of his smile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did I know the mighty Will</span><br />
Whom the Puritans once cursed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like our Goethe,&mdash;yet must he,</span><br />
<br />
Luckless sinner, in this host<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ride a charger black as coal.</span><br />
Close beside him on an ass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rode a mortal and&mdash;great heavens!</span><br />
<br />
By the weary mien of prayer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the snowy night-cap too,</span><br />
And the terror of his soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Francis Horn I recognized.<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a></span><br />
<br />
Commentaries he composed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On that great and cosmic child,</span><br />
Shakespeare&mdash;therefore at his side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He must ride through thick and thin.</span><br />
<br />
Lo, poor silent Francis rides,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He who scarcely dared to walk,</span><br />
He who only stirred himself<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At tea-tables and at prayers.</span><br />
<br />
Surely all the oldish maids<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who indulged him in his ease,</span><br />
Will be startled when they hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his riding rough and free.</span><br />
<br />
When the gallop faster grows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then great William glances down</span><br />
On his commentator meek<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jogging onward on his ass.</span><br />
<br />
To the saddle clinging tight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fainting in his terror sheer,</span><br />
Yet unto his author loyal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his death as in his life.<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a></span><br />
<br />
Many ladies there I saw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that crazy train of ghosts,</span><br />
Many lovely nymphs with forms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slender with the grace of youth.</span><br />
<br />
On their steeds they sat astride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mythologically nude!</span><br />
Though their tresses thick and long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fell like cloaks of stranded gold.</span><br />
<br />
Garlands rustled on their heads<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they swung their laurelled staves,</span><br />
Bending back in reckless ways,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full of joyous insolence.</span><br />
<br />
Mediæval maids I saw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Buttoned high unto the chin,</span><br />
On their saddles seated slant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poising falcons on their wrists.</span><br />
<br />
Like a burlesque, from behind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On their hacks and skinny nags</span><br />
Came a rout of merry wenches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most extravagantly garbed.<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a></span><br />
<br />
And each face, though lovely quite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bore a trace of impudence;</span><br />
Madly would they shriek and yell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Puffing up their painted cheeks.</span><br />
<br />
How this tumult echoed there!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laughter, blare of huntsmen's horns;</span><br />
Neigh of horses, bark of dogs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crack of whips! hallo! hurrah!</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">CANTO XIX</span><br />
<br />
<br />
But like Beauty's clover-leaf,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the very midst arose</span><br />
Three fair women. I shall never<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their majestic forms forget!</span><br />
<br />
Well I knew the first! Her head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glittered with the crescent moon.</span><br />
Haughty, like some ivory statue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sat the goddess on her steed.</span><br />
<br />
And her fluttering tunic fell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loose about her hips and breasts,</span><br />
And the torchlight and the moon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laved with love her snowy limbs.</span><br />
<br />
Marble seemed her very face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And like marble cold. How dread</span><br />
Was the pallor and the chill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that stern and noble front!<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a></span><br />
<br />
But within her dusky eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smouldered a mysterious,</span><br />
Cruel and enticing fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which devoured my poor soul.</span><br />
<br />
What a change has come o'er Dian<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since in outraged chastity</span><br />
She smote Actæon to a stag<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a quarry for his hounds!</span><br />
<br />
Doth she now requite this crime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this gallant company,</span><br />
Riding like some ghostly mortal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the bleak, nocturnal air?</span><br />
<br />
Late did passion wake in her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But for that the stronger burns,</span><br />
And within her eyes its flames<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gleam like fiercest brands of hell.</span><br />
<br />
For those vanished times she grieves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the men were beautiful;</span><br />
Now in quantity perchance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She forgets their quality.<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a></span><br />
<br />
At her side a fair one rode&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair, but not by Grecian lines</span><br />
Was she fair; for all her features<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shone with wondrous Celtic glow.</span><br />
<br />
'Twas Abunda, fairy queen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom to know I could not fail</span><br />
By the sweetness of her smile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the madness of her laugh!</span><br />
<br />
Full and rosy was her face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the faces limned by Greuze;</span><br />
And from out her heart-shaped mouth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flashed the splendour of her teeth!</span><br />
<br />
All the winds made dalliance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With her robe of azure blue,</span><br />
And such shoulders never I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In my wildest dreams beheld.</span><br />
<br />
I was almost moved to leap<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the window for a kiss;</span><br />
This had been sheer folly, true,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ending in a broken neck!<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a></span><br />
<br />
Ah, and she, she would have laughed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If within that awful gulf</span><br />
I had fallen at her feet;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laughter such as this I know!</span><br />
<br />
And the third fair phantom, she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who so moved my errant heart,&mdash;</span><br />
Was this but some female fiend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the other figures twain?</span><br />
<br />
Whether devil this or saint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Know I not. With women, ah,</span><br />
None can ever know where saint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ends nor where the fiend begins.</span><br />
<br />
All the magic of the East<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay within her glowing face,</span><br />
And her dress brought memories<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Scheherazadê's tales.</span><br />
<br />
Lips as red as pomegranates<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a curved nose lily white,</span><br />
Limbs as slender and as cool<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As some green oasis-palm.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></span><br />
<br />
From her palfrey white she leaned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flanked by giant Moors who trod</span><br />
Close beside the queenly dame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Holding up the golden reins.</span><br />
<br />
Of most royal blood was she,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She the Queen of old Judea,</span><br />
She great Herod's lovely wife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She who craved the Baptist's head.</span><br />
<br />
For this crimson crime was she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Banned and cursed. Now in this chase</span><br />
Must she ride, a wandering spook,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the dawn of Judgment Day.</span><br />
<br />
Still within her hands she bears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That deep charger with the head</span><br />
Of the Prophet, still she kisses&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kisses it with fiery lips.</span><br />
<br />
For she loved the Prophet once,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though the Bible naught reveals,</span><br />
Yet her blood-stained love lives on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Storied in her people's hearts.<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a></span><br />
<br />
How might else a man declare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the longing of this lady?</span><br />
Would a woman crave the head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a man she did not love?</span><br />
<br />
She perchance was slightly vexed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With her darling, and was moved</span><br />
To behead him, but when she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the trencher saw his head,</span><br />
<br />
Then she wept and lost her wits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dying in love's madness straight.</span><br />
(What! Love's madness? pleonasm!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love itself is madness still!)</span><br />
<br />
Rising nightly from her grave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To this frenzied hunt she hies,</span><br />
In her hands the gory head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which with feline joy she flings</span><br />
<br />
High into the air betimes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laughing like a wanton child,</span><br />
Cleverly she catches it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like some idle rubber ball.<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a></span><br />
<br />
As she swept past me she bowed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most coquettishly and looked</span><br />
On me with her melting eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So that all my heart was stirred.</span><br />
<br />
Thrice that rout raged up and down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Past my window, then did she,</span><br />
Ah, most beautiful of shades!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Greet me with her precious smile.</span><br />
<br />
Even when the pageant dimmed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the tumult silent grew</span><br />
In my brain, that smiling face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shone and beckoned on and on.</span><br />
<br />
All that night I tossed and turned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My o'erwearied limbs on straw,</span><br />
Musty straw. No feather-beds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Uraka's hut I found!</span><br />
<br />
And I mused: what might this mean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This mysterious beckoning?</span><br />
Why, Oh, why, Herodias,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Held thy look such tenderness?</span><br />

<br />
<br />
Sunrise. Golden arrows dart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the pallid ranks of mist</span><br />
Till they redden as with wounds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dissolve in shining light.</span><br />
<br />
Now hath triumph come to Day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the gleaming conqueror</span><br />
In his blinding glory treads<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the ridges and the peaks.</span><br />
<br />
All the merry bands of birds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twitter in their hidden nests,</span><br />
And the scent of plants arises<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a psalm of odours rare.</span><br />
<br />
At the early glint of day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down the valley we had gone.</span><br />
While Lascaro dumb and dour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Followed up the bear-tracks dim,<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a></span><br />
<br />
I with musings sought to slay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Time, but tired soon I grew</span><br />
Of my musings,&mdash;drear, ah, drear!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were my thoughts and void of joy.</span><br />
<br />
Weary, joyless, down I sank<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a bank of softest moss</span><br />
'Neath a great and kingly ash<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where a little spring gushed forth.</span><br />
<br />
This with wondrous voice beguiled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All my wayward mood until</span><br />
Thought and thinking vanished both<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the music of the spring.</span><br />
<br />
Mighty longings seized me then,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Madness, dreams and death-desires,</span><br />
Longings for those splendid queens<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Riding in that ghostly throng.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, ye lovely shapes of night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Banished by the rose of dawn,</span><br />
Whither, tell me, have ye fled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whither have ye flown by day?<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a></span><br />
<br />
Somewhere 'neath old temple-ruins<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the wide Romagna hid,</span><br />
It is said Diana flees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dominion of the Christ.</span><br />
<br />
Only in the midnight gloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dare she venture forth, but then</span><br />
How she joys the merry chase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the pagan sports of old!</span><br />
<br />
Fay Abunda also fears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All these sallow Nazarenes,</span><br />
So by day she hides herself<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deep in secret Avalon.</span><br />
<br />
For this sacred island lies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the still and silent sea</span><br />
Of Romanticism, whither<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">None save wingèd steeds may go.</span><br />
<br />
There no anchor Care may drop,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never there do steamships touch,</span><br />
Bringing loads of Philistines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With tobacco-pipes, to stare.<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a></span><br />
<br />
Never does that dismal, dull<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ring of bells this stillness break&mdash;</span><br />
That atrocious bumm-bamm sound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which all gentle fairies hate.</span><br />
<br />
There, abloom with lasting youth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In unbroken joyfulness,</span><br />
Lives that merry-hearted dame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Golden-locked Abunda fair.</span><br />
<br />
Laughing there she strolls between<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Huge sun-flowers drenched with light,</span><br />
Followed by her retinue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of unworldly Paladins.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, but thou, Herodias,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Say, where art thou? Ah, I know!</span><br />
Thou art dead and buried deep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Jerusholayim's walls!</span><br />
<br />
Corpse-like is thy sleep by day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In thy marble coffin laid,</span><br />
But at midnight dost thou wake<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the crack of whips! hurrah!<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a></span><br />
<br />
With Abunda, Dian, too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dost thou join the headlong plunge</span><br />
And the blithesome hunter rout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fleeing from all cross and care.</span><br />
<br />
What companions rare and blithe!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might but I, Herodias,</span><br />
Ride at night through forests dark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I would gallop at thy side!</span><br />
<br />
For of all I love thee most!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More than any goddess Grecian,</span><br />
More than any northern fay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do I love thee, Jewess dead!</span><br />
<br />
Yea, I love thee most! 'Tis true,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the trembling of my soul!</span><br />
Love me too and be my sweet,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loveliest Herodias!</span><br />
<br />
Love me too and be my love!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fling that gory block-head far</span><br />
With its trencher. Sweeter dishes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shall give thee to enjoy.<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a></span><br />
<br />
Am not I thy proper knight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom thou seekest? What care I</span><br />
If perchance thou'rt dead and damned&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Prejudices I have none!</span><br />
<br />
Is my own salvation not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a parlous state? And oft</span><br />
Do I question if my life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still be linked with human lives.</span><br />
<br />
Take me, take me as thy knight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thine own <i>cavalier servente</i>;</span><br />
I will bear thy silken robe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And each wayward mood of thine.</span><br />
<br />
Every night beside thee, love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With this crazy horde I'll ride,</span><br />
And we'll kiss and thou shalt laugh<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At my quips and merry pranks.</span><br />
<br />
I will help thee speed the hours<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the night. And yet by day</span><br />
All my joy shall pass;&mdash;in tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shall sit upon thy grave.<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a></span><br />
<br />
Aye, by day will I sit down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the dust of kingly vaults,</span><br />
At the grave of my belovèd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Jerusholayim's walls!</span><br />
<br />
Then the grey Jews passing by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will imagine that I mourn</span><br />
The destruction of thy temple<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thy gates, Jerusholayim.</span><br />

<br />
Shipless Argonauts are we,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Foot loose in the mighty hills,</span><br />
But instead of golden fleece<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We seek Bruin's shaggy hide.</span><br />
<br />
Naught but sorry devils twain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heroes of a modern cut,</span><br />
And no classic bard will ever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make us live within his song!</span><br />
<br />
Even though we suffered dire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hardships! What torrential rains</span><br />
Fell upon us at the peak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where was neither tree nor cab!</span><br />
<br />
Cloudbursts! Heaven's dykes were down!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in bucketsful it poured&mdash;</span><br />
Jason, lost on Colchis bleak,<br />

"Six-and-thirty kings I'll give<br />

Weary unto death and glum,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wet as drownèd rats, we came</span><br />
Back unto the witch's hut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the middle of the night.</span><br />
<br />
There beside the glowing hearth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sat Uraka with a comb,</span><br />
Toiling o'er her swollen pug;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Him she quickly flung aside</span><br />
<br />
As we entered. First my couch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She prepared, then bent to loose</span><br />
From my feet the <i>espardillos</i>,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Footgear comfortless and rude!</span><br />
<br />
Helped me to disrobe,&mdash;she drew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Off my pantaloons which clung</span><br />
To my legs as close and tight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the friendship of a fool.<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a></span><br />
<br />
"Oh, a dressing-gown! I'd give<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Six-and-thirty kings," I cried,</span><br />
"For a dry one!"&mdash;as my shirt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wringing wet, began to steam.</span><br />
<br />
Shivering, with chattering teeth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There I stood beside the hearth,</span><br />
Till the fire drowsed me quite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then upon the straw I sank.</span><br />
<br />
Sleepless but with blinking eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peered I at the witch who crouched</span><br />
By the fire with her son's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Body spread upon her lap.</span><br />
<br />
Upright at her side the pug<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stood, and in his clumsy paws,</span><br />
Very cleverly and tight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Held aloft a little jar.</span><br />
<br />
From this did Uraka take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reddish fat and salved therewith</span><br />
Swift Lascaro's ribs and breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With her thin and trembling hands.<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a></span><br />
<br />
And she hummed a lullaby<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a high and nasal tone</span><br />
As she rubbed him with the salve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Midst the crackling of the fire.</span><br />
<br />
Sere and bony like a corpse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay the son upon the lap</span><br />
Of his mother; opened wide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stared his pale and tragic eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Is he really dead, this man?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kept alive by mother-love?</span><br />
Nightly by the witch-fat potent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Salved into a magic life?</span><br />
<br />
Oh, that strange, strange fever-sleep!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In which all my limbs grew stiff</span><br />
As if fettered, yet each sense,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Overwrought, waked horribly!</span><br />
<br />
How that smell of hellish herbs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plagued me! Musing in my woe,</span><br />
Long I thought where had I once<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smelled such odours?&mdash;but in vain.<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a></span><br />
<br />
How the wind within the flue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wrought me terror! Like the sobs</span><br />
Of some parchèd soul it rang&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or some well-remembered voice!</span><br />
<br />
But these stuffed birds standing guard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a board above my head,</span><br />
These grim birds tormented me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far beyond all other things!</span><br />
<br />
Slowly, gruesomely they moved<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their accursèd wings and bent</span><br />
Low to me with monstrous bills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bills like human noses huge.</span><br />
<br />
Where had I such noses seen?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well, mayhap in Hamburg once,</span><br />
Or in Frankfort's ghetto dim;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Memory smote me harshly then.</span><br />
<br />
But at last did slumber quite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Overcome me and in place</span><br />
Of such waking phantoms crept<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wholesome and unbroken dreams.<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a></span><br />
<br />
And within my dream the hut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quickly to a ball-room changed,</span><br />
High on lofty pillars borne<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And illumed by chandeliers.</span><br />
<br />
There invisible musicians<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Played from "Robert le Diable"</span><br />
That atrocious dance of nuns<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I promenaded there.</span><br />
<br />
But at last the portals wide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Open and with stately step</span><br />
Slowly in the hall appear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Guests most wonderful and strange.</span><br />
<br />
Every one a bear or spectre!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Striding upright every bear</span><br />
Leads an apparition wrapped<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a white and gleaming shroud.</span><br />
<br />
Coupled in this wise, each pair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up and down began to waltz</span><br />
Through the hall. O strangest sight!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fit for laughter and for fear!<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a></span><br />
<br />
How those plump old animals<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Panted in the paces set</span><br />
By those filmy shapes of air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whirling gracefully and light!</span><br />
<br />
Pitiless, the harried beasts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus were borne along until</span><br />
Their deep panting overdroned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even the orchestral bass!</span><br />
<br />
When betimes the couples crashed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In collision, then each bear</span><br />
Gave the pushing spectre straight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hearty kicks upon the rump.</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes in the tumult too<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the cerements fell away</span><br />
From each white and muffled head,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lo! a grinning skull appeared!</span><br />
<br />
But at last with shattering blare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yelled the horns, the cymbals clashed</span><br />
And the thunder of the drums<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brought about the gallopade.<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a></span><br />
<br />
But the end of this, alas,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came not to my dreams. For, lo,</span><br />
One most clumsy bear trod full<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On my corns&mdash;I shrieked and woke!</span><br />

<br />
<br />
Ph&oelig;bus in his solar coach,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whipping up his steeds of flame,</span><br />
Had traversed the middle part<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his journey through the skies,</span><br />
<br />
Whilst in sleep I lay a-dream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the goblins and the bears</span><br />
Winding like mad arabesques<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through my slack and heated brain.</span><br />
<br />
When I wakened it was noon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I found myself alone,</span><br />
Since my hostess and Lascaro<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the chase had left at dawn.</span><br />
<br />
There was no one save the pug<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the hovel. There he stood</span><br />
By the hearth beside the pot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Holding in his paws a spoon.<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a></span><br />
<br />
Clever pug! well disciplined!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lest the steaming soup boil over,</span><br />
Swift he stirred it round and round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Skimming off the foam and scum.</span><br />
<br />
But&mdash;am I bewitchèd too?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or does fever smoulder still</span><br />
In my brain? For scarce can I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Trust my ears. The pug-dog speaks!</span><br />
<br />
Aye, he speaks in homely strains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Swabian dialect,</span><br />
Deeply sunk in thought, he cries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As it were within a dream:</span><br />
<br />
"Woe is me&mdash;a Swabian bard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Banned in exile must I grieve</span><br />
In a pug-dog's cursèd shape<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Guardian of a witch's pot.</span><br />
<br />
"What a base and hideous crime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is this sorcery! My fate</span><br />
Ah, how tragic! I, a man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the body of a dog!<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a></span><br />
<br />
"Had I but remained at home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With my jolly comrades true&mdash;</span><br />
No vile sorcerers are they!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their spells no man need fear.</span><br />
<br />
"Had I but remained at home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At Karl Meyer's&mdash;with the sweet</span><br />
Noodles of the Vaterland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And good honest metzel-soup!</span><br />
<br />
"Of homesickness I shall die!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might I only spy the smoke</span><br />
Rising from old Stuttgart's flues<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the precious dumplings seethe."</span><br />
<br />
Pity seized me when I heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This sad story, and I sprang</span><br />
From my couch and took a seat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the fireplace and spake:</span><br />
<br />
"Noble poet, tell what chance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brought thee to this beldam's hut.</span><br />
Why, oh why, in cruel wise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wast thou changed into a dog?"<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a></span><br />
<br />
But the pug exclaimed in joy:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What! You are no Frenchman then?</span><br />
But a German, and you've heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All my hapless monologue?</span><br />
<br />
"Ah, dear countryman, 'twas ill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That old Köllè, Councillor,</span><br />
When at eve we sat and argued<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the inn o'er pipe and mug,</span><br />
<br />
"Should have harped on the idea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That by travel only might</span><br />
One attain such culture broad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As by travel he attained!</span><br />
<br />
"Now, so I might shed the rude<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Husk that on my manners lay,</span><br />
Even as Köllè, and attain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Polish from the world at large,</span><br />
<br />
"To my home I bade farewell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in quest of culture came</span><br />
To the Pyrenees at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Uraka's little hut.<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a></span><br />
<br />
"And a reference I brought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Justinus Kerner too!</span><br />
Never did I dream my friend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stood in league with such a witch!</span><br />
<br />
"Friendly was Uraka's mood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till at last with horrid shock,</span><br />
Lo, I found her friendliness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had to fiery passion grown.</span><br />
<br />
"Yes, within that withered breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lust blazed up in monstrous wise,</span><br />
And at once this vicious crone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sought to drag me down to sin.</span><br />
<br />
"Yet I prayed: 'Oh, pardon, ma'am!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do not fancy I am one</span><br />
Of those wanton Goethe Bards,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I belong to Swabia's school.</span><br />
<br />
"'Sweet Morality's our Muse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the drawers she wears are made</span><br />
Of the stoutest leather&mdash;Oh!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do not wrong my virtue, pray!<a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a></span><br />
<br />
"'Other bards may boast of soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Others phantasy&mdash;and some</span><br />
Of their passion&mdash;Swabians have<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nothing but their innocence.</span><br />
<br />
"'Nothing else do we possess!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do not rob me of my pure,</span><br />
Most religious beggar's cloak,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Naked else my soul must go!'</span><br />
<br />
"Thus I spoke, whereat the hag<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smiled with hideous irony,</span><br />
Seized a switch of mistletoe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smote me over brow and cheek.</span><br />
<br />
"Chilly spasms seized me then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just as if a goose's skin</span><br />
Crept across my limbs&mdash;but oh!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This was worse than goose's-skin!</span><br />
<br />
"It was nothing more nor less<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than a dog-pelt! Since that hour,</span><br />
That accursèd hour, I've lived<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Changed into a lumpy pug!"<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a></span><br />
<br />
Luckless wight! his piteous sobs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now denied him further speech,</span><br />
And so bitterly he wept<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he half dissolved in tears.</span><br />
<br />
"Hark!" I spoke in pity then,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Tell me how you might be freed</span><br />
From this dog-skin. How may I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give you back to muse and man?"</span><br />
<br />
In despair, disconsolate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he raised his paws in air,</span><br />
And with sobs and groans at length<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus his mournful plaint he made:</span><br />
<br />
"Not before the Judgment Day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall I shed this horrid form,</span><br />
If no noble virgin come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To absolve me of the curse.</span><br />
<br />
"None can free me save a maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pure, untouched by any man,</span><br />
And she must fulfil a pact<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most inexorable&mdash;thus:<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a></span><br />
<br />
"Such unspotted maiden must<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Sylvester's holy night</span><br />
Read the verse of Gustav Pfizer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Read it and not fall asleep!</span><br />
<br />
"If her chaste eyes do not close<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the reading&mdash;then, O bliss!</span><br />
I shall disenchanted be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breathe as man&mdash;unpugged at last!"</span><br />
<br />
"In that case, alas," said I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Never may I undertake</span><br />
Your salvation, for you see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">First I am no spotless maid,</span><br />
<br />
"And, still more impossible,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Secondly, I ne'er could read</span><br />
Any one of Pfizer's poems<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not fall asleep at once."</span><br />

<br />
<br />
From this eerie witch-menage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the valley down we went,</span><br />
And once more our feet took hold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the good and solid Earth.</span><br />
<br />
Spectres hence! Hence, gibbering masks!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shapes of air and fever-dreams!&mdash;</span><br />
Once again, most sensibly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let us deal with Atta Troll.</span><br />
<br />
In the cavern with his young<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bruin lies in slumber wrapt,</span><br />
Snoring like an honest soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he stretches, yawns and wakes.</span><br />
<br />
And young One-Ear crouches down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At his side, his head he rakes</span><br />
Like a poet seeking rhymes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And upon his paws he scans.<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a></span><br />
<br />
Close beside the father lie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Atta Troll's belovèd girls,</span><br />
Pure, four-footed lilies they,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stretched in dreams upon their backs.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, what tender thoughts must glow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the budding souls of these</span><br />
Snow-white virgin bearesses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With their soft and dewy eyes?</span><br />
<br />
And the youngest of them all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seems most deeply stirred. Her heart,</span><br />
Smitten by Dan Cupid's shaft,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quivers with a blissful throe.</span><br />
<br />
Yea, this godling's arrow pierced<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through and through her furry pelt</span><br />
When she saw him first&mdash;Oh, heavens!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis a mortal man she loves!</span><br />
<br />
Man it is&mdash;Schnapphahnski named,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who one day in mad retreat</span><br />
Passed her as she wandered through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dim passes of the hills.<a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a></span><br />
<br />
Woes of heroes move the fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And within our hero's face,</span><br />
Quite as usual, sorrow lowered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pallid care and money-need.</span><br />
<br />
Spent were all his funds of war!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two-and-twenty silver groats</span><br />
Taken unto Spain by him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Espartero seized as spoil.</span><br />
<br />
Aye, his very watch was gone!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This in Pampeluna's pawnshop</span><br />
Lay in bondage. 'Twas a rich<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heirloom all of silver made.</span><br />
<br />
Little thought he as he ran<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On his long legs through the woods,</span><br />
He had won a greater thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than a fight&mdash;a loving heart!</span><br />
<br />
Yes, she loves him&mdash;him the born<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enemy of bears she loves!</span><br />
Hapless maid! If but your sire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knew it&mdash;oh! what rage were his!<a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a></span><br />
<br />
Just like Odoardo old<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who in honest burgess-pride</span><br />
Stabbed Emilia Galotti&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even so would Atta Troll</span><br />
<br />
Rather slay his darling lass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slay her with his proper paws,</span><br />
Than that she should ever sink<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even into princely arms!</span><br />
<br />
Yet in this same moment he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is as softly moved&mdash;"no rose</span><br />
Would he pluck before the storm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reft it of its petals fair."</span><br />
<br />
Atta Troll in saddest mood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lies within his rocky cave.</span><br />
Like Death's warning o'er him creeps<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hunger for infinity.</span><br />
<br />
"Children!" then he sobs, the tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burst from out his mournful eyes,&mdash;</span><br />
"Children! soon my earthly days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall be ended&mdash;we must part.<a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a></span><br />
<br />
"Unto me this very noon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came a dream of import vast,</span><br />
And my soul drank in the sweet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sense of early death-to-be.</span><br />
<br />
"Superstitious am I not,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor fantastic&mdash;ah, and yet</span><br />
More things lie 'twixt Earth and Heaven<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than philosophy may dream.</span><br />
<br />
"Pondering on the world and fate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yawning I had dropped asleep,</span><br />
And I dreamed that I was lying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stretched beneath a mighty tree.</span><br />
<br />
"From the branches of this tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">White celestial honey dripped</span><br />
Straight into my open jaws,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Filling me with wondrous bliss.</span><br />
<br />
"Peering happily aloft<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon I spied within the leaves</span><br />
Seven pretty little bears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gliding up and down the boughs.<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a></span><br />
<br />
"Delicate and dainty things,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All with pelts of rosy hue,</span><br />
And their heavenly voices rang<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a melody of flutes!</span><br />
<br />
"As they sang an icy chill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seized my flesh, although my soul</span><br />
Like a flame went soaring straight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gleaming into highest Heaven."</span><br />
<br />
Thus with soft and quivering grunts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spake our Atta Troll, then grew</span><br />
Silent in his wistful grief.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Suddenly his ears he raised,</span><br />
<br />
And in strangest wise they twitched!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then from up his couch he sprang</span><br />
Trembling, bellowing with joy:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Children! do you hear that voice!</span><br />
<br />
"Are not those the dulcet tones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of your mother? Do I not</span><br />
My dear Mumma's grumbles know?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mumma! Mumma! precious mate!"<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a></span><br />
<br />
Like a madman with these words<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the cave rushed Atta Troll</span><br />
Swift to his destruction&mdash;oh!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his ruin straight he plunged.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
In the Vale of Roncesvalles,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On that very spot where erst</span><br />
Charlemagne's great nephew fell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gasping forth his warrior soul,</span><br />
<br />
Fell and perished Atta Troll,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fell through ambush, even as he</span><br />
Whom that Judas of the Knights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ganelon of Mainz, betrayed.</span><br />
<br />
Oh! that noblest trait in bears&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conjugal affection&mdash;love&mdash;</span><br />
Formed a pitfall which Uraka<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In her evil craft prepared.</span><br />
<br />
For so truly mimicked she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Coal-black Mumma's tender growls,</span><br />
That poor Atta Troll was lured<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the safety of his lair.<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a></span><br />
<br />
On desire's wings he ran<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the valley, halting oft</span><br />
By a rock with tender sniff,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thinking Mumma there lay hid.</span><br />
<br />
There Lascaro lay, alas,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his rifle. Swift he shot</span><br />
Through that gladsome heart a ball,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a crimson stream welled forth.</span><br />
<br />
Twice or thrice he shakes his head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To and fro, at last he sinks</span><br />
Groaning, seized with ghastly shudders;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Mumma!" is his final sob!</span><br />
<br />
Thus our noble hero fell&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perished thus. Immortal he</span><br />
Yet shall live in strains of bards,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Resurrected after death.</span><br />
<br />
He shall rise again in song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his wide renown shall stalk</span><br />
In this blunt trochaic verse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the round and living Earth.<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a></span><br />

In Valhalla's Hall a shaft<br />

<br />
<br />
Three-and-thirty wrinkled dames,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wearing on their heads their Basque</span><br />
Scarlet hoods of ancient style,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stood beside the village gate.</span><br />
<br />
One of them, like Deborah,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beat the tambourine and danced</span><br />
While she sang a hymn in praise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the slayer of the bear.</span><br />
<br />
Four strong men in triumph bore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slaughtered Atta, who erect</span><br />
In his wicker litter sat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like some patient at a spa.</span><br />
<br />
To the rear, like relatives<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the dead, Lascaro came</span><br />
With Uraka, who abashed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nodded to the right and left.<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a></span><br />
<br />
Then the town-clerk at the hall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spoke as the procession came</span><br />
To a halt. Of many things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spoke that dapper little man.</span><br />
<br />
As, for instance, of the rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the navy, of the Press,</span><br />
Of the sugar-beet debates,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that hydra, party strife.</span><br />
<br />
All the feats of Louis Philippe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vaunted he unto the skies,&mdash;</span><br />
Of Lascaro then he spoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his great heroic deed.</span><br />
<br />
"Thou Lascaro!" cried the clerk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he mopped his streaming brow</span><br />
With his bright tri-coloured sash&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thou Lascaro! thou that hast</span><br />
<br />
"Freed Hispania and France<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From that monster Atta Troll,</span><br />
By both lands shalt be acclaimed the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pyreneean Lafayette!"<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a></span><br />
<br />
When Lascaro in official<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wise thus heard himself announced</span><br />
As a hero, then he smiled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his beard and blushed for joy.</span><br />
<br />
And in stammering syllables<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in broken phrases he</span><br />
Stuttered forth his gratitude<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the honour shown to him.</span><br />
<br />
Wonder-smitten then stood all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the unexpected sight,</span><br />
And in low and timid tones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus the ancient women spoke:</span><br />
<br />
"Did you hear Lascaro laugh?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did you see Lascaro blush?</span><br />
Did you hear Lascaro speak?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He the witch's perished son!"</span><br />
<br />
On that very day they flayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Atta Troll. At auction they</span><br />
Sold his hide. A furrier bid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just an even hundred francs.<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a></span><br />
<br />
And the furrier decked the skin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Handsomely, and mounted it</span><br />
All on scarlet. For this work<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He demanded twice the cost.</span><br />
<br />
From a third hand Juliet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then received it. Now it lies</span><br />
As a rug before her bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the city by the Seine.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, how many nights I've stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Barefoot on the earthly husk</span><br />
Of my hero great and true,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the hide of Atta Troll!</span><br />
<br />
Then by sorrow deeply touched<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would I think of Schiller's words:</span><br />
"That which song would make eternal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">First must perish from the Earth."</span><br />

<br />
What of Mumma? Mumma, ah!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is a woman. Frailty</span><br />
Is her name! Alas, that women<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should be frail as porcelain!</span><br />
<br />
Now when Fate had parted her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From her great and noble mate,</span><br />
Did she perish of her woe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sinking into hopeless gloom?</span><br />
<br />
Nay, contrarywise, she lived<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Merrily as ever&mdash;danced</span><br />
For the public as before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eager for their plaudits too.</span><br />
<br />
And at last a splendid place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And support for all her days</span><br />
Was procured for her in Paris<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the old Jardin-des-Plantes.<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a></span><br />
<br />
There, last Sunday as I strolled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through that place with Juliet,</span><br />
Baring Nature's realms to her&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Animal and vegetable,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Tall giraffes, and cedars brought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of Lebanon, the huge</span><br />
Dromedary, golden pheasants,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the zebra;&mdash;chatting thus,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
We at last stood still and leaned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the rampart of that pit</span><br />
Where the bears are safely penned&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heavens! what a sight we saw!</span><br />
<br />
There a huge bear from the wastes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Siberia, snowy-white,</span><br />
Dallied in a love-feast sweet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a she-bear small and dark.</span><br />
<br />
This was Mumma! This, alas,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was the mate of Atta Troll!</span><br />
Well I knew her by the soft<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glances of her dewy eye.<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a></span><br />
<br />
It was she! the daughter dark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Southland! Mumma lives</span><br />
With a Russian now; she lives<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With this savage of the North!</span><br />
<br />
Smirking spake a negro then,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Coming up with stealthy pace:</span><br />
"Could there be a fairer sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than a pair of lovers, say?"</span><br />
<br />
Then I answered him: "Pray, who<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Honours me by this address?"</span><br />
Whereupon he cried amazed:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Have you quite forgotten me?</span><br />
<br />
"Why I am that Moorish prince<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who beat drums in Freiligrath&mdash;</span><br />
Times were bad&mdash;in Germany<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was lonely and forlorn.</span><br />
<br />
"Now as keeper I'm employed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this garden,&mdash;here I find</span><br />
All the flowers of my native<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tropics,&mdash;lions, tigers, too.<a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a></span><br />
<br />
"Here I feel content and gay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Better than at German fairs,</span><br />
Where each day I beat the drum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And was fed but scantily.</span><br />
<br />
"Late in wedlock was I bound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a blonde Alsatian cook,</span><br />
And within her arms I feel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All my native joys again!</span><br />
<br />
"And her feet remind me ever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my blessèd elephants,</span><br />
And her French has quite the ring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my sable mother-tongue.</span><br />
<br />
"When she coughs, the rattle fierce<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Moves me of that famous drum</span><br />
Which, bedecked with human skulls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drove the snakes and lions far.</span><br />
<br />
"But when moonlight charms her mood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a crocodile she weeps,</span><br />
Which from out some luke-warm stream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lifts to gape in cooler air.<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a></span><br />
<br />
"And she cooks me dainty bits.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See, I thrive! I feed again</span><br />
As upon the Niger I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fed with gusto African!</span><br />
<br />
"Mark the nicely rounded paunch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I possess! Behold it peeps</span><br />
From my shirt like some black moon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stealing forth from whitest clouds."</span><br />

<p class="c top15">PREFACE</p>

<p class="notes">THE GOD OF SCHELLING. The German
philosopher Schelling (1775-1854) was at
first a follower of Spinoza, and had published
in his youth a pantheistic philosophy which
had made him famous. In later life he began
to doubt his former beliefs, and promised to
the world another and more Christian explanation
of God and the universe. The
promised book, however, never appeared.</p>

<p class="nind">The gap, thus left by Schelling, has since
been filled up by a host of more courageous,
if less conscientious, investigators.</p>

<p class="notes">"SEA-SURROUNDED SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN"
OYSTERS. "Schleswig-Holstein
Meerumschlungen (sea-surrounded)" was
the German Marseillaise after 1846 and
again in 1863-64.</p>

<p class="notes">ARNOLD RUGE (1802-1880) was the leader
of the New Hegelian school, and published<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a>
certain famous annuals for art and science at
Halle. In 1848 he was elected to the Parliament
at Frankfort, but was forced to flee to
London, where he struck up a fast friendship
with Mazzini. In the Revolutionary Committee
of London he represented Germany,
as Ledru-Rollin represented France and
Mazzini Italy.</p>

<p class="notes">CHRISTIAN-GERMANIC. One of the favourite
phrases and shibboleths of the Romantic
School, which may still be heard in the
Germany of to-day.</p>

<p class="notes">FERDINAND FREILIGRATH (1810-1876).
A well-known poet and skilful translator of
French and English poets, such as Burns,
Byron, Thomas Moore, and Victor Hugo.
His own poems betray his dependence upon
Hugo. Frederick William IV, King of
Prussia, bestowed a pension upon him in
1842. When his friends, however, charged
him with having sold himself to the
Government, the poet refused the pension.<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>
Thereafter he devoted himself more and
more to the democratic party and wrote
many political poems. In 1848 he went
abroad, living in London the greater part
of the time. He returned to Germany in
1868, and in 1870 published several patriotic
poems which met with great acclaim.</p>

<p class="nind">The sudden conversion from international
Democracy to Nationalism is easily explained.
Modern states have become democratic,
and democrats&mdash;but they alone&mdash;find
it easy to feel comfortable and patriotic
in such a milieu.</p>

<p class="notes">DON CARLOS. After the death of Ferdinand

<p class="notes">SCHNAPPHAHNSKI. A comic word composed
of the German word "schnappen," to<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>
snap, and "hahn," cock. It has also been
incorporated into French in the form "chenapan."
It is applied here to Prince Felix
Lichnowski (1814-1848), who left the Prussian
Army in 1838 and entered the service
of Don Carlos, who appointed him a brigadier-general.
After his return from Spain,
Lichnowski wrote his "Reminiscences,"
the publication of which involved him in
a duel in which he was badly wounded. The
"Reminiscences" are couched in Heine's own
style, and their hero is called Schnapphahnski.</p>

the most enthusiastic advocates of German
gymnastics. Athletics was one of the pet
ideas of the German patriots; the Government,
however, held it in suspicion, inasmuch
as the so-called "Turner" (gymnasts)
cherished political ambitions. In time, however,
the exercise of the muscles cured the
revolutionary brain-fag, and the Government
was enabled to assume a sort of protectorship
over gymnastics. Though enthusiastically
carried on to this very day in Germany, the
movement no longer has any political significance.</p>

in his "Löwenritt." The allusion to the mule
(in German "camel," which bears the same
opprobrious meaning as "ass") gives us
reason to believe that Heine's preface must
not be taken too seriously and that his opinion
of the poet Freiligrath was by no means a
high one.</p>

<p class="notes">LUDWIG FEUERBACH (1804-1872). An
honest thinker, who recognised that there
was an unbridgable gulf between philosophy
and theology. He left the Hegelian school,
which can be so well adapted to the need of
theologians, and considered as the only source
of religion&mdash;the human brain. "The Gods
are only the personified wishes of men," he
used to say. He brought German philosophy
down from the clouds to cookery by declaring:
"Der Mensch ist, was er isst" ("Man is what he
eats"). He was a believer in what he called
"Healthy sensuality," which made him the
philosopher of artists in the 'thirties and
'forties of the last century, amongst others
of Richard Wagner. The latter, however,<a name="page_172" id="page_172"></a>
afterwards repented, and, by way of Schopenhauer,
turned Christian.</p>

<p class="nind">Feuerbach came from a family that would

author of "Hereditary Genius." Feuerbach's
father was a famous jurist, who had
five sons, all of whom attained the honour

The philosopher was the fourth son. Again:

his nephew, the son of his eldest brother.</p>

and so little in those of mankind at
large. His "Critique of the Evangelistic

<p class="notes">THE WILD HUNT which Heine describes
in this canto is an old German legend which
poets and painters have found to be a fertile
source of inspiration. The wild huntsman
must ride through the world every night,
followed by all evil-doers, and wherever he
appears, thither, according to old folk-belief,
does misfortune come. Tradition herds all
the foes of Christianity among this rout of
evil-doers; for this reason does Heine include
Goethe&mdash;the "great pagan," as the Germans
call him&mdash;in that crew. There have been
other foes of Christianity since, and some<a name="page_176" id="page_176"></a>
very great figures amongst them, so that in

become quite presentable.</p>

of King Arthur's Round Table) played a great
part in the romantic poetry of Germany, and
later in the music dramas of Wagner. Romanticism
is therefore represented in Heine's
poem by the fairy Abunda, in contradistinction
to the Greek and Semitic inspiration&mdash;represented
by Diana and Herodias. Heine's
conception of Herodias as being in love with
the Baptist and taking her revenge on him
for his Josephian attitude towards her, has,
no doubt, influenced later writers on the
subject, especially Flaubert and Oscar Wilde,
save that these had not the courage (nor
perhaps the insight) to regard the hero in
question as a "block-head."</p>

Christian mediævalism, which, however, no
remedy can restore to health. The smell in
Uraka's hut is the smell of the "rotting
past," that, in spite of all nostrums and
artificial revivals, goes on decomposing. The
stuffed birds which glare so fixedly and forlorn,
and have long bills like human noses,
are members of Heine's own race. These
stuffed birds are the symbols of Judaism which
according to our Hellenistic poet, possesses, as
religion, as little life as the Christianity that
is based upon it.</p>


<p class="canto">CANTO XXII</p>

<p class="notes">A SWABIAN BARD. The Swabian school of
poetry, of which Uhland was the leader, was
the chief representative of German Chau<a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a>vinism
in Heine's day. W. Menzel, the critic
who denounced "Young Germany" to the
Government, belonged to this school. Börne
answered him in his "Menzel der Franzosenfresser"
("The Gallophobe"), and Heine
mocked at him in his paper "The Denunciator."
Gustav Pfizer (who had provoked
Heine) and Karl Meyer were members of the
Swabian school, and prided themselves particularly
upon their morality and religiosity,
for which reason they set themselves in
antagonism to the "heathen" Goethe.
Goethe, on his part, estimated this school as
little as did Heine. In a letter to Zelter dated
October 5, 1831, Goethe writes thus of
Pfizer: "...I read a poem lately by
Gustav Pfizer ... the poet appears to have
real talent and is evidently a very good man.
But as I read I was oppressed by a certain
poverty of spirit in the piece and put the little
book away at once, for with the advance of the
cholera it is well to shield oneself against all
debilitating influences. The work is dedicated
to Uhland, and one might well doubt if any<a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a>thing
exciting, thorough, or humanly compelling
could be produced from those regions
in which he is master. I will therefore not
rail at the work, but simply leave it alone.
<i>It is really marvellous how these little men
are able to throw their goody-religious-poetic
beggar's cloak so cleverly about their shoulders
that, whenever an elbow happens to
stick out, one is tempted to consider this as
a deliberate poetic intention</i>."</p>

order to obtain some knowledge of the supernatural
world. Thousands of those who
believed, or wished to believe, came to his
"séances." He worked in conjunction with
a celebrated medium of his time, and later
published a very successful book about this
lady. Heine, no doubt, had this medium in

versifier. His mania for compression and

After abandoning his career as a diplomat,
von Ense married the celebrated Rahel. He
lived in Berlin, where the salon of his wife
became the meeting-ground for artists and
writers. In his youth he associated closely
with the romantics&mdash;de la Motte Fouqué,
Chamisso, and Clemens Brentano, the brother
of Bettina von Arnim. Though imitating
the heavy and cautious style of the later
Goethe he was a good writer, and his biographies
of celebrated men belong to the best
in German literature. He endeavoured, but
without success, to win over the all-powerful
Austrian Minister Metternich to the cause of
"Young Germany."</p>

<p class="notes">OTHER TIMES AND OTHER BIRDS!
These words refer to the new generation of
poets&mdash;Georg Herwegh, Friedrich Freiligrath,<a name="page_185" id="page_185"></a>
Dingelstedt, Hoffmann von Fallersleben, and
Anastasius Grün&mdash;who came upon the scene
about 1840, cherished mechanic-democratic
ideals and brought about the Revolution of
1848. Heine, by nature an aristocratic poet,
who instinctively dreaded the competition
of "noble bears," saw all his loftiest principles
trodden into the mire by these Utopian
hot-heads and the crew of politicians that
came storming after them. This doctrinaire
and numerical interpretation of the rights
of man&mdash;for which rights in their proper
application the poet himself had fought so
valiantly&mdash;caused him great unhappiness.
He now saw his fairest concepts (as is made
clear in his own introduction) distorted as in
some crooked mirror, and so, filled with
anger, grief and disgust, he conceived and
wrote his lyrico-satiric masterpiece, "Atta
Troll." The poem has been misunderstood
to this very day, for the mechanics and
theorists have practically won. <i>The day it
is understood, their reign will be over</i>.<a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a></p>
